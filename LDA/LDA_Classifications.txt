discover properties of other Web services. Since the overall system may not be available statically and since each business process is supposed to be relatively simple, we propose to use runtime monitoring of conversations between partners as a means of checking behavioral correctness of the entire Web service system. Specifically, we identify a subset of UML 2.0 sequence diagrams as a property specification language and show that it is sufficiently expressive for capturing safety and liveness properties. By transforming these diagrams to automata, we enable conformance checking of finite execution traces against the specification. We show how our language can be used to specify the specification property system (SPS). We describe an implementation of our approach as part of an industrial system. Finally, we discuss our experience of specifying and monitoring a number of properties from three existing applications.DELIMITER1

issued a joint call for papers targeting the bridging of service perspectives from business (e.g., service science, services marketing and information systems) to services computing. The intent was to advance transdisciplinary research agendas that could generate advances that go beyond the sum of independent research streams. As with all transdisciplinary research ideals, these efforts are extremely difficult, as pioneers need to overcome significant barriers, including different vocabularies, different research methods and differences in each field's historical evolution. This special section provides a snapshot of research efforts that begin to break down barriers. We offer special thanks to those authors who took the risk of having their manuscripts processed by an esteemed set of invited guest editors who have expertise from across the services spectrum.DELIMITER1

$k$DELIMITER1
spatial keyword queries, where spatial and textual data are encrypted in a unified way. To search with the encrypted tree index, we propose two effective techniques for the similarity computations between queries and tree nodes under encryption. To improve query performance on large-scale spatio-textual data, we further propose a keyword-based secure pruning method. Thorough analysis shows the validity and security of our scheme. Extensive experimental results on real datasets demonstrate our scheme achieves high efficiency and good scalability.DELIMITER1

which is far more than previous findings. Beside shared resources of memory sub-system, blindness of hypervisor's scheduler have large impact on the slowdown and this is contrary to recent researches that mostly blame last-level cache (LLC) contention for performance degradation. After investigating the causes of performance degradation, we provide some ideas that motivate researchers to reduce performance degradation through hardware and software techniques. We also mention some hints that help organizations to see if their applications are ready for the cloud.DELIMITER1

We show that the optimal average service time is independent of the applications service requirement. Evaluation shows that MobiCoRE can accommodate up to 50 percent extra users when operating at optimal service time and sharing mobile resources for remaining task, compared to completing the entire user applications in cloudlet. Similarly, up to 47 percent time benefit can be achieved for mobile devices by sharing only 16 percent computational resources with the cloudlet.DELIMITER1

to capture these recurring differences and to provide solutions to resolve them. We leverage mismatch patterns for service adaptation with two approaches: by developing stand-alone adapters and via service modification. We then dig into the notion of adaptation aspects that, following aspect-oriented programming paradigm and service modification approach, allow for rapid development of adapters. We present a study showing that it is a preferable approach in many cases. The proposed approach is implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype tool, and evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative methods.DELIMITER1

), for a repository with n services. However, the approach takes linear time for sequential compositions when service applicability is performed by service discovery and thus, it is shown to give asymptotically optimal performance. Although optimality in the number of services deployed is not guaranteed, our experiments on public benchmark data sets show correct optimized solutions 100% of the time, with a reduction in the average running time, compared to a well-performed planning-based system, of better than 35% over 207 composition problems.DELIMITER1

, rather than the entire set M(Q, G). Moreover, the existing GPM method for matching the designated node vDELIMITER1
<sub>0</sub>DELIMITER1
does not consider the multiple constraints of the attributes associated with each vertex and each edge which commonly exist in real applications, like the constraints of social contexts for the experts recommendation in contextual social. In this paper, we first propose the Multi-Constrained Top-K Graph Pattern Matching problem (MC-Top-K-GPM), which involves the NP-Complete Multiple Constrained GPM problem. To address the efficiency and effectiveness issues of MC-Top-K-GPM in large-scale social graphs, we propose a novel index, called HB-Tree, which indexes the label and degree of nodes in G and can get candidates of vDELIMITER1
<sub>0</sub>DELIMITER1
efficiently. Furthermore, we develop a Multi-Constrained Top-K GPM method, called MTK, which can identify Top-K matches of vDELIMITER1
<sub>0</sub>DELIMITER1
effectively and efficiently. Using real-life data, we experimentally verify that MTK outperforms the existing GPM algorithms in both efficiency and effectiveness in solving the MC-TOP-K GPM problem.DELIMITER1

<em>Business Process Execution Language for Web Services WS-BPEL</em>DELIMITER1
provides an technology to aggregate encapsulated functionalities for defining high-value Web services. For a distributed application in a B2B interaction, the partners simply need to expose their provided functionality as BPEL processes and compose them. Verifying such distributed web service based systems has been a huge topic in the research community lately–cf. [4]for a good overview. However, in most of the work on analyzing properties of interacting Web Services, especially when backed by stateful implementations like WS-BPEL, the data flow present in the implementation is widely neglected, and the analysis focusses on control flow only. This might lead to false-positive analysis results when searching for design weaknesses and errors, e. g. analyzing the controllability [14] of a given BPEL process. In this paper, we present a method to extract dataflow information by constructing a CSSA representation and detecting data dependencies that effect communication behavior. Those discovered dependencies are used to construct a more precise formal model of the given BPEL process and hence to improve the quality of analysis results.DELIMITER1
